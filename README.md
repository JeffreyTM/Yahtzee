# Yahtzee (WIP)
Coded by Jeffrey Michaels using Windows Form Apps in the .NET framework.

Features: Full playable (and replayable) Yahtzee game with stats collection

# Getting Started
From the main menu, click "Play Game" to start a new Yahtzee game or "View Stats" to view your local stats

# Game Form
In the game form, click "Roll" initially to start the game.

After each roll, click a dice block to "hold" it, preventing the block from being rolled until either the block is clicked again or the round ends. 

After three rolls, the round ends and a score must be selected. Note: you are allowed to select a score before three rolls. 

The game ends when the scorecard is completely filled. After the game is over, your stats will be stored in the stats form

# Stats Form
In the stats form, there are two tabs: "Game History" and "Score and Roll Totals"

"Game History" displays each game's unique ID, the date and time the game was played, and its total score. Clicking on a specific game will bring up its scorecard

"Score and Roll Totals" displays various stats for each score on a scorecard and each potential dice roll

Score stats: Score Type, Times Scored, Total Score, Average Score Per Game

Roll stats: Times Rolled, Turns Held, Average Rolls Per Game, Most Times Rolled in one Game, Least Times Rolled in One Game
